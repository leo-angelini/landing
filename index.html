       <h1>Come get a coffee, surrounded by music.</h1>
       This project is born from a passion about music. For a long time now, i was looking for a place which provides artists performances in a chill café. A place where people can immerge themselves in a bubble out of time and surrounded by good music. A place where you can work, chill, discuss and share your passion.
       
          <br><br>Blue Moon Café is also a place aiming to be a spotlight for unknown artists. In the environment of a coffee, relations have more chance to click giving an area more propitious to discussions.

        <h2>Get some tickets !</h2>
        In this coffee, our animation will be made on a scene where artists picked beforehand showcase their original songs on live performances like « mini-concerts », while it’s also an animation for the clients, the artists may benefit from it by visibility. <br>
        <br> You can get FREE tickets here to experimente a DJ set this summer !
